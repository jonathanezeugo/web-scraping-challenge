# web-scraping-challenge
Missions_to_Mars


This homework was very instructive as it afforded the opportunity to put into practice the concepts taught in class about webscrapping and the many uses it affords any individual in the web development field of data analytics. The focus is on Mars. The capacity of science to investigate the unknown has been at the core of human development especially over the last century. Mars is a planet with lots of intrigues and reaching out for this "red" plannet is a principal endeavor of mankind, especially the science community.

Step 1
The first part of the homework involved the scrapping exercise. Using Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas library and Requests/Splinter, as key tools, the website: https://mars.nasa.gov/news/?page=0&per_page=40&order=publish_date+desc%2Ccreated_at+desc&search=&category=19%2C165%2C184%2C204&blank_scope=Latest code named NASA Mars News Site was scrapped and the latest News Title and Paragraph text was obtained and passed to reference variables.The obtained variables are news_title and news_par for the latest news title and the latest paragraph text respectively.
